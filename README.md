The **PoE Ethernet GPIB Adapter** is designed to interface test equipment with GPIB / HPIB / IEEE-488 interfaces.

The primary goal of this project is to provide an easy solution to connect multiple GPIB-equipped instruments over Ethernet without excessive cabling. It can, at choice, use the Prologix protocol or support VXI-11.2 (VISA).

## Why?

The motivation behind this project comes from the challenges of using several generations of instruments with GPIB interfaces. In theory, only one GPIB master is needed, and up to 20+ instruments can be connected in any order using suitable GPIB cabling. However, there are drawbacks:

- Instruments must be fully compliant with the IEEE-488 standard. Many older instruments, predating the standard, do not comply. The main issue is that the bus does not go Hi-Z when off, requiring certain instruments to be powered on even if you're only using another device.
- GPIB cabling is bulky and expensive. While used options can sometimes be found, the overall cost remains high.

At work, this has been solved elegantly using commercial Ethernet adapters, each assigned an address and connected directly to the instrument. However, these adapters are priced around $500 USDâ€”far from hobbyist-friendly. My initial solution was to buy one adapter and rely on daisy-chaining, but as my instrument collection grew to 20 devices requiring GPIB, this approach was no longer practical. Hence, the **PoE Ethernet GPIB Adapter** was born.

## Design Criteria

1. Lower cost: Total BOM should be less than 50 USD.
2. Support Power over Ethernet (PoE) to minimize cable clutter.
3. Include USB-C power as an alternative if PoE is unavailable.
4. Enable GPIB communication over both Ethernet and USB-C interfaces.
5. Use the same communication protocol as existing commercial units.
6. Minimize radiated and conducted noise to avoid interference in test environments.
7. Include a simple, easy-to-print 3D-printed enclosure to keep costs low.

## Results

All design goals have been met[^2]. The current unit price is approximately $45 USD when ordering parts for 20 units. Prices increase for smaller batch sizes.

[^2]: GPIB commands over USB-C is Work In Progress.

In my home lab, I assign each device a static IP address based on its MAC address and run a local DNS server to provide easy-to-remember domain names, making the adapter simple and intuitive to use.

## VXI-11 or Prologix

This code can produce either a VXI-11.2 device, or a Prologix device (the ROM is not big enough for both at the same time, although the code is compatible with cohabitation). Switching between VXI-11 and Prologix is done at compile time. If compiler option `-DINTERFACE_PROLOGIX` is used, the firmware produced is for Prologix.

VXI-11.2 allows discovery over the network, and uses the following VISA connection strings:

- Controller[^1]: `TCPIP::{IP address}::INSTR` (unless you have set the default instrument address to something else than 0)
- Instruments: `TCPIP::{IP address}::gpibY,N::INSTR` or `TCPIP::{IP address}::instN::INSTR` (and even the legacy form `TCPIP::{IP address}::hpibY,N::INSTR`), all where `N` is their address on the GPIB bus (1..30), and `Y` is simply ignored.

Example: `TCPIP::192.168.7.105::gpib,2::INSTR` for instrument with GPIB address 2 on the gateway having IP address 192.168.7.105.

[^1]: controller, gateway, adapter: different names for the same.

### VXI-11.2 compatibility

With the limited resources, this device is meant to work with the most common tools, like for example pyVisa. It is not a full implementation, and lacks the following advanced features (for now):

- secondary instrument addresses
- async VXI-11 operations
- instrument locking via VXI-11
- VXI-11 interrupts
- the VXI-11 abort channel
- for now: complete end of reply handling. This will be corrected. It now only supports reading on eoi, and therefor misses correct handling of
  - terminating character supplied in the read request packet
  - maximum size requested in the read request packet

It is discoverable via UDP, but there is no publication via mDNS (yet).

Not all of the above will be possible with the limited resources the device has, but let us know if you encounter any problems, and we'll look if it is possible to make the implementation more complete.

### The number of instruments you can connect

The GPIB bus protocol itself allows up to 30 instruments. This does not mean you can effectively control 30 instruments via the gateway, as the gateway device has its electrical limits, depending on the length of the cables and instruments themselves. And also the software has its limits:

The Prologix service will allow only 1 client software connection and will allow you to interact with only 1 instrument at any given time: you must switch between the instruments you want to address.

The VXI-11 service will allow you to set up multiple instrument connections at the same time. It will allow your client software to be easier to set up and maintain, and will make it easier to interact with multiple instruments, whether they are connected to the gateway or not. There is a however a limit to the number of open connections to the gateway:

- up to 4 instruments: no restriction
- 5 instruments: only if you do not use the web server
- 6 instruments: only if you disable the web server (use the compile option `-DDISABLE_WEB_SERVER`)
- 7 or more: not possible via VXI-11

This does not mean that you cannot physically connect more instruments to the gateway, it just means that you cannot connect to more of them, via your client software, *at the same time*.

Also, be aware that the GPIB bus is a shared bus. Even if you have connected to multiple instruments, you might encounter problems if you run multiple commands or queries *at the same time*, via for example multiprocessing or threading.

### Large replies or large requests

The limited memory of the device puts limitations on the size of the requests and the repllies. The device will not accept requests bigger than X **(TODO)** bytes, and replies bigger than roughly Y **(TODO)** bytes. In case of overflow, the client will be informed via VXI signalling.

The prologix service does not have this limitation, as it it built on a simpler protocol, and uses streaming.

## The User Interface of the device

There are 3 parts:

- the **LED**. It indicates different states: blue for waiting for DHCP, red for error in network or DHCP, green flashing for idle, green/blue flashing for busy
- the **Web Server** (on port 80): it shows some help texts and the number of connected clients. It is not (yet) interactive.
- the **serial console** (via USB): This console shows startup information, ports used, and has a small menu. 

### The serial menu

This menu is rather basic. Be aware that it requires 'enter' for each command.

It has the following options:

- Setting of IP address. By default, the device starts with DHCP. You can however force a fixed IP address.
- Setting of the default instrument address (only with VXI-11, as Prologix has its own command for that). The default is 0, meaning: the gateway itself. If you only have 1 instrument connected, or want to designate a "preferred" instrument, you can set it to the address of any instrument on the bus. That way, the gateway becomes transparent, and you can use the default (and the discoverable) VISA connection string to address that instrument.
